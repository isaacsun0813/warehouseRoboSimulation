# Simulations utilized to emulate warehouse robot carbon consumptions within a multi-agent system
# Utilized within our final research paper titled: Sustainability-oriented Material Selection and Memory System Design for Warehouse Robots
# This is a VERY VERY rough approximation. It will need to be fine-tuned with more specific parameters however this can be used as a rough methodology for how it should be done.
